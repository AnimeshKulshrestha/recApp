# recApp
This repository contains the code for an android application that uses Microsoft Azure cognitive services to convert Speech to text,
which is then stored in a .txt file and uploaded on firebase.
This app follows a model in which each user can create a course and add students then provide them with trancriptions for each lecture
and the students can download them and use them for their help.
